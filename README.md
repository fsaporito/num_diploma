C project for the final examination at high school. 

After the function has been inserted (polynomial, trigonometric orexpontential), the programs check the function's properties, es:

  - continuity
  - monotony
  - derivable
  - contunuous derivate
  - monotone derivate
  - derivable two times
  - derivable four times
  

Then it proceeds to calculate one root in the selected interval (with user preferred precision), with one of the following:

 - Dicotomic Method
 - Cord Method [Both recursive and itnerative, automatically decided by reasoning on the function properties]
 - Newton Method
 

At the end, the program calculates the area of the interval given, with one of the three following methods:

  - Rectangle Method [Returns both the superior and the inferior rectangle calculation]
  - Trapezoid Method
  - Cavalieri-Simpson Method [Parabolas]
